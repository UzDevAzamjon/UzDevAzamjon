<I><p color:red;>Is the Chevrolet Tahoe a Good SUV?
Yes, the Chevrolet Tahoe is a great large SUV. In fact, we named it a finalist for our 2021 Best Large SUV for Families because of its solid combination of cargo and passenger space, safety and reliability ratings, positive reviews from automotive journalists, and available family-friendly features. It’s relatively easy to maneuver despite its bulk, and it has three capable engine options, including two brutish V8s and a thrifty turbodiesel. The Chevy also has a tremendous amount of passenger and cargo space. On top of that, this SUV has a richly outfitted infotainment system and a class-leading predicted reliability rating.

Why You Can Trust Us: 8 Reviews Analyzed
To make our car rankings and reviews as consumer-oriented as possible, we do not rely on our personal opinions. Instead, we analyze hard data such as cargo space dimensions, mpg ratings, and predicted reliability, as well as the opinions of the automotive press.

U.S. News Best Cars has been ranking and reviewing vehicles since 2007, and our staff has more than 75 years of combined experience in the auto industry. To ensure our objectivity, we never accept expensive gifts from carmakers, and an outside firm manages the ads on our site.

Should I Buy the Chevrolet Tahoe?
This Chevrolet is a great choice, but it’s not the only appealing SUV in its class. The GMC Yukon shares many of the Tahoe’s strengths but undercuts the Chevrolet’s starting price by around $2,700. If you like the Tahoe but want even more room for your passengers and their belongings, consider its long-wheelbase sibling, the Chevrolet Suburban.

2020 vs. 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe: What's the Difference?
Chevrolet redesigned the Tahoe for the 2021 model year. The new Tahoe features an upgraded infotainment system with a larger touch screen (10.2 inches, up from 8), more standard driver-assistance features, a much larger cargo hold, an additional 10 inches of third-row legroom, and revamped exterior and interior styling. A turbodiesel engine will be added later in 2020.
